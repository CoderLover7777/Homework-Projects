        <div class="text1">
            Chess is a game with a board and many pieces. The pieces are black and white.
        </div>
        <div class="text2">
            Each piece moves in its own way. Some go straight, some go side to side, and one jumps over other pieces.
        </div>
        <div class="text3">
            People take turns moving their pieces. They try to checkmate the other king.
        </div>
        <p class="p1">
            Chess helps you think and be patient. It’s like a quiet game of thinking.
        </p>
