            The Rubik's Cube is a 3D combination puzzle originally invented in 1974 by Ernő Rubik.
            It consists of six faces covered by nine stickers of six solid colors. The goal is to twist and turn
            the cube so that each face is a single, uniform color. Solving the cube involves applying algorithms
            that move specific layers without disturbing the rest of the puzzle. There are many variations, including
            the 2×2, 4×4, and 5×5 cubes. Competitive "speedcubers" use techniques and finger tricks to solve the cube
            in just seconds.

            The Rubik's Cube has become an icon of intelligence, creativity, and problem-solving. It has inspired
            mathematical studies, robotics applications, and even art installations. Online solvers and tutorials
            help beginners learn the basic layer-by-layer method, while advanced cubers practice CFOP, Roux, or ZZ
            methods. With over 43 quintillion possible combinations, the Rubik’s Cube remains one of the world’s most
            fascinating puzzles.
